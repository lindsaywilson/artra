<p>If you haven&#8217;t tested 3.9 yet, you&#8217;re running out of time! We made about five dozen changes since the <a title=\"WordPress 3.9 Release Candidate\" href=\"//wordpress.org/news/2014/04/wordpress-3-9-release-candidate/\">first release candidate</a>, and those changes are all helpfully summarized <a href=\"//make.wordpress.org/core/?p=10237\">in our weekly post</a> on the development blog. Probably the biggest fixes are to live widget previews and the new theme browser, along with some extra TinyMCE compatibility and some RTL fixes.</p>
<p><strong>Plugin authors:</strong> Could you test your plugins against 3.9, and if they&#8217;re compatible, make sure they are marked as tested up to 3.9? It only takes a few minutes and this really helps make launch easier. Be sure to follow along the core development blog; we&#8217;ve been posting <a href=\"//make.wordpress.org/core/tag/3-9-dev-notes/\">notes for developers for 3.9</a>. (For example: <a href=\"//make.wordpress.org/core/2014/04/15/html5-galleries-captions-in-wordpress-3-9/\">HTML5</a>, <a href=\"//make.wordpress.org/core/2014/04/14/symlinked-plugins-in-wordpress-3-9/\">symlinks</a>, <a href=\"//make.wordpress.org/core/2014/04/07/mysql-in-wordpress-3-9/\">MySQL</a>, <a href=\"//make.wordpress.org/core/2014/04/11/plupload-2-x-in-wordpress-3-9/\">Plupload</a>.)</p>
<p>To test WordPress 3.9 RC2, try the <a href=\"//wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wordpress-beta-tester/\">WordPress Beta Tester</a> plugin (you’ll want “bleeding edge nightlies”). Or you can <a href=\"//wordpress.org/wordpress-3.9-RC2.zip\">download the release candidate here</a> (zip). If you’d like to learn more about what’s new in WordPress 3.9, visit the nearly complete About screen in your dashboard (<strong><img src=\"//i0.wp.com/core.svn.wordpress.org/branches/3.6/wp-content/themes/twentyten/images/wordpress.png?w=692\" alt=\"\" width=\"16\" height=\"16\" /> → About</strong> in the toolbar) and also check out <a title=\"WordPress 3.9 Beta 1\" href=\"//wordpress.org/news/2014/03/wordpress-3-9-beta-1/\">the Beta 1 post</a>.</p>

<p>The &#8220;Quick Draft&#8221; tool on the dashboard screen was broken in the 3.8.2 update. If you tried to use it, your draft would disappear and it wouldn&#8217;t save. While we doubt anyone was writing a novella using this tool, <em>any</em> loss of content is unacceptable to us.</p>
<p>We recognize how much trust you place in us to safeguard your content, and we take this responsibility very seriously. We&#8217;re sorry we let you down.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve all lost words we&#8217;ve written before, like an email thanks to a cat on the keyboard or a term paper to a blue screen of death. Over the last few WordPress releases, we&#8217;ve made a number of improvements to features like autosaves and revisions. With revisions, an old edit can always be restored. We&#8217;re trying our hardest to save your content somewhere even if your power goes out or your browser crashes. We even monitor your internet connection and prevent you from hitting that &#8220;Publish&#8221; button at the exact moment the coffee shop Wi-Fi has a hiccup.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s <em>possible</em> that the quick draft you lost last week is still in the database, and just hidden from view. As an added complication, these &#8220;discarded drafts&#8221; normally get deleted after seven days, and it&#8217;s already been six days since the release. If we were able to rescue your draft, you&#8217;ll see it on the &#8220;All Posts&#8221; screen after you update to 3.8.3. (We&#8217;ll also be pushing 3.8.3 out as a background update, so you may just see a draft appear.)</p>
<p>So, if you tried to jot down a quick idea last week, I hope WordPress has recovered it for you. Maybe it&#8217;ll turn into that novella.</p>
<p><a href=\"http://wordpress.org/download/\">Download WordPress 3.8.3</a> or click &#8220;Update Now&#8221; on Dashboard → Updates.</p>
<p><em>This affected version 3.7.2 as well, so we&#8217;re pushing a 3.7.3 to these installs, but we&#8217;d encourage you to update to the latest and greatest.</em></p>

<p>We hope to ship WordPress 3.9 <em>next week</em>, but we need your help to get there. If you haven’t tested 3.9 yet, there’s no time like the present. (Please, not on a production site, unless you’re adventurous.)</p>
<p>To test WordPress 3.9 RC1, try the <a href=\"//wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wordpress-beta-tester/\">WordPress Beta Tester</a> plugin (you’ll want “bleeding edge nightlies”). Or you can <a href=\"//wordpress.org/wordpress-3.9-RC1.zip\">download the release candidate here</a> (zip). If you’d like to learn more about what’s new in WordPress 3.9, visit the work-in-progress About screen in your dashboard (<strong><img src=\"//i0.wp.com/core.svn.wordpress.org/branches/3.6/wp-content/themes/twentyten/images/wordpress.png?w=692\" alt=\"\" width=\"16\" height=\"16\" /> → About</strong> in the toolbar) and check out <a title=\"WordPress 3.9 Beta 1\" href=\"//wordpress.org/news/2014/03/wordpress-3-9-beta-1/\">the Beta 1 post</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Think you’ve found a bug? </strong>Please post to the <a href=\"//wordpress.org/support/forum/alphabeta/\">Alpha/Beta area in the support forums</a>. If any known issues come up, you’ll be able to <a href=\"//core.trac.wordpress.org/report/5\">find them here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>If you&#8217;re a plugin author</strong>, there are two important changes in particular to be aware of:</p>
<ul>
<li>TinyMCE received a major update, to version 4.0. Any editor plugins written for TinyMCE 3.x might require some updates. (If things broke, we&#8217;d like to hear about them so we can make adjustments.) For more, see TinyMCE&#8217;s <a href=\"http://www.tinymce.com/wiki.php/Tutorial:Migration_guide_from_3.x\">migration guide</a> and <a href=\"http://www.tinymce.com/wiki.php/api4:index\">API documentation</a>, and the notes on the <a href=\"//make.wordpress.org/core/2014/01/18/tinymce-4-0-is-in-core/\">core development blog</a>.</li>
<li>WordPress 3.9 now uses the MySQLi Improved extension for sites running PHP 5.5. Any plugins that made direct calls to <code>mysql_*</code> functions will experience some problems on these sites. For more information, see the notes on the <a href=\"//make.wordpress.org/core/2014/04/07/mysql-in-wordpress-3-9/\">core development blog</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Be sure to follow along the core development blog, where we will be continuing to post <a href=\"//make.wordpress.org/core/tag/3-9-dev-notes/\">notes for developers for 3.9</a>. (For example, read <a href=\"//make.wordpress.org/core/2014/03/27/masonry-in-wordpress-3-9/\">this</a> if you are using Masonry in your theme.) And please, please update your plugin&#8217;s <em>Tested up to</em> version in the readme to 3.9 before April 16.</p>
<p><em>Release candidate<br />

<p>It also contains a fix to prevent a user with the Contributor role from improperly publishing posts. Reported by <a href=\"http://edik.ch/\">edik</a>.</p>
<p>This release also fixes nine bugs and contains three other security hardening changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pass along additional information when processing pingbacks to help hosts identify potentially abusive requests.</li>
<li>Fix a low-impact SQL injection by trusted users. Reported by <a href=\"http://www.dxw.com/\">Tom Adams</a> of dxw.</li>
<li>Prevent possible cross-domain scripting through Plupload, the third-party library WordPress uses for uploading files. Reported by <a href=\"http://szgru.website.pl/\">Szymon Gruszecki</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>We appreciated <a href=\"http://codex.wordpress.org/FAQ_Security\">responsible disclosure</a> of these security issues directly to our security team.

<p>Sites that support automatic background updates will be updated to WordPress 3.8.2 within 12 hours. If you are still on WordPress 3.7.1, you will be updated to 3.7.2, which contains the same security fixes as 3.8.2. We don&#8217;t support older versions, so please update to 3.8.2 for the latest and greatest.</p>
<p>Already testing WordPress 3.9? The first release candidate is <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/wordpress-3.9-RC1.zip\">now available</a> (zip) and it contains these security fixes. Look for a full announcement later today; we expect to release 3.9 next week.</p>

<p><strong>This software is still in development,</strong> so we don’t recommend you run it on a production site. Consider setting up a test site just to play with the new version.

There, you can also find <a href=\"http://core.trac.wordpress.org/tickets/major\">a list of known bugs</a> and <a href=\"http://core.trac.wordpress.org/query?status=closed&amp;group=component&amp;milestone=3.9\">everything we’ve fixed</a> so far.</p>
<p><strong>This software is still in development,</strong> so we don’t recommend you run it on a production site. Consider setting up a test site just to play with the new version.

<p>WordPress 3.9 is due out next month &#8212; but in order to hit that goal, <strong>we need your help</strong> testing all of the goodies we&#8217;ve added:</p>
<ul>
<li>We updated TinyMCE, the software powering the visual editor, to the latest version. Be on the lookout for cleaner markup. Also try the new paste handling &#8212; if you paste in a block of text from Microsoft Word, for example, it will no longer come out terrible. (The &#8220;Paste from Word&#8221; button you probably never noticed has been removed.) It&#8217;s possible some plugins that added stuff to the visual editor (like a new toolbar button) no longer work, so we&#8217;d like to hear about them (<a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/24067\">#24067</a>). (And be sure to <a href=\"http://wordpress.org/support/\">open a support thread</a> for the plugin author.)</li>
<li>We&#8217;ve added <strong>widget management to live previews</strong> (the customizer). Please test editing, adding, and rearranging widgets! (<a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/27112\">#27112</a>) We&#8217;ve also added the ability to upload, crop, and manage header images, without needing to leave the preview. (<a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/21785\">#21785</a>)</li>
<li>We brought 3.8&#8217;s beautiful new theme browsing experience to the <strong>theme installer</strong>. Check it out! (<a title=\"View ticket\" href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/27055\">#27055</a>)</li>
<li><strong>Galleries</strong> now receive a live preview in the editor. Upload some photos and insert a gallery to see this in action. (<a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/26959\">#26959</a>)</li>
<li>You can now <strong>drag-and-drop</strong> images directly onto the editor to upload them. It can be a bit finicky, so try it and help us work out the kinks. (<a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/19845\">#19845</a>)</li>
<li>Some things got improved around <strong>editing images</strong>. It&#8217;s a lot easier to make changes to an image after you insert it into a post (<a class=\"closed\" title=\"View ticket\" href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/24409\">#24409</a>) and you no longer get kicked to a new window when you need to crop or rotate an image (<a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/21811\">#21811</a>).</li>
<li>New <strong>audio/video playlists</strong>. Upload a few audio or video files to test these. (<a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/26631\">#26631</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>If you think you’ve found a bug</strong>, you can post to the <a href=\"http://wordpress.org/support/forum/alphabeta\">Alpha/Beta area</a> in the support forums. We&#8217;d love to hear from you! If you’re comfortable writing a reproducible bug report, <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/reports/\">file one on the WordPress Trac</a>.

<p><strong>DEVELOPERS!</strong> Hello! There&#8217;s lots for you, too.</p>
<p><strong>Please test your plugins and themes!</strong> There&#8217;s a lot of great stuff under the hood in 3.9 and we hope to blog a bit about them in the coming days. If you haven&#8217;t been reading the awesome <a href=\"http://make.wordpress.org/core/tag/week-in-core/\">weekly summaries</a> on the <a href=\"http://make.wordpress.org/core/\">main core development blog</a>, that&#8217;s a great place to start. (You should definitely follow that blog.) For now, here are some things to watch out for when testing:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>load process in multisite</strong> got rewritten. If you notice any issues with your network, see <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/27003\">#27003</a>.</li>
<li>We now use the <strong>MySQL Improved (mysqli) database extension</strong> if you&#8217;re running a recent version of PHP (<a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/21663\">#21663</a>). Please test your plugins and see that everything works well, and please make sure you&#8217;re not calling <code>mysql_*</code> functions directly.</li>
<li><strong>Autosave</strong> was refactored, so if you see any issues related to autosaving, heartbeat, etc., let us know (<a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/25272\">#25272</a>).</li>
<li>Library updates, in particular Backbone 1.1 and Underscore 1.6 (<a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/26799\">#26799</a>). Also Masonry 3 (<a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/25351\">#25351</a>), PHPMailer (<a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/25560\">#25560</a>), Plupload (<a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/25663\">#25663</a>), and TinyMCE (<a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/24067\">#24067</a>).</li>
<li>TinyMCE 4.0 is a <em>major</em> update. Please see TinyMCE&#8217;s <a href=\"http://www.tinymce.com/wiki.php/Tutorial:Migration_guide_from_3.x\">upgrade guide</a> and our <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/24067\">implementation ticket</a> for more. If you have any questions or problems, please <a href=\"http://wordpress.org/support/forum/alphabeta\">open a thread in the support forums</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Happy testing!</p>
<p><em><em>Lots of improvements<br />
Little things go a long way</em><br />
Please test beta one<br />

<p>Version 3.8.1 is a maintenance releases that addresses 31 bugs in 3.8, including various fixes and improvements for the new dashboard design and new themes admin screen. An issue with taxonomy queries in WP_Query was resolved. And if you&#8217;ve been frustrated by submit buttons that won&#8217;t do anything when you click on them (or thought you were going crazy, like some of us), we&#8217;ve found and fixed this &#8220;dead zone&#8221; on submit buttons.</p>
<p>It also contains a fix for <strong>embedding tweets</strong> (by placing the URL to the tweet on its own line), which was broken due to a recent Twitter API change. (For more on Embeds, see <a href=\"http://codex.wordpress.org/Embeds\">the Codex</a>.)</p>
<p>For a full list of changes, consult the <a href=\"http://core.trac.wordpress.org/query?milestone=3.8.1\">list of tickets</a> and <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/log/branches/3.8?rev=27018&amp;stop_rev=26862\">the changelog</a>. There&#8217;s also a <a href=\"http://make.wordpress.org/core/2014/01/22/wordpress-3-8-1-release-candidate/\">detailed summary</a> for developers on the development blog.</p>
<p>If you are one of the millions already running WordPress 3.8, we will start rolling out automatic background updates for WordPress 3.8.1 in the next few hours. For sites <a href=\"http://wordpress.org/plugins/background-update-tester/\">that support them</a>, of course.</p>

It was great to share stories, experiences, and discuss the future of each platform with Bui.</p>
<p>As bonus material, <a href=\"http://joomlabe.at/podcast/ep50-google-hangout-talking-about-joomla-eco-system#.U64ZE7GTHVc\" title=\"http://joomlabe.at/podcast/ep50-google-hangout-talking-about-joomla-eco-system#.U64ZE7GTHVc\">listen to Episode 50</a> of the JoomlaBeat podcast which features a roundtable discussion of the Joomla ecosystem. Not only do they talk about Joomla but they also discuss WordPress and Drupal as well. I thought it was interesting to hear their pros and cons for each project, especially WordPress&#8217;.</p>

Last year&#8217;s event was by all accounts a smashing success and included diverse attendees from around the world. Approximately 70% of those in attendance flew in from outside the Netherlands.</p>
<p>The organizers expect 900+ attendees this year, which would make it one of the largest WordPress events of the year. Fortunately, they were able to secure the <a href=\"http://www.ndk.bg/\" target=\"_blank\">National Palace of Culture</a> for the venue, the largest multifunctional congress, conference, convention and exhibition center in Southeastern Europe.</p>

<p>Due to the success of the previous year, companies are rushing to <a href=\"http://2014.europe.wordcamp.org/sponsor-wordcamp-europe/\" target=\"_blank\">sponsor the event</a>, and the packages are even cheaper because of the lower cost of the location. The organizers reported that all the top tier sponsorship packages were sold out within 24 hours last year.</p>
<p>In a recent <a href=\"http://joshspeaking.com/matt-mullenweg/\" target=\"_blank\">interview</a>, Matt Mullenweg noted that May 2014 marked the first time that non-English downloads of WordPress surpassed the number of English downloads. Although the software was created by English-speaking people, its user base is rapidly expanding to become more representative of the world&#8217;s population. WordCamp Europe is currently one of the few events that demonstrates the true diversity of the community by bringing together a massive multicultural, multilingual group of WordPress users and professionals.</p>
<p>If you want to connect with the European WordPress community, Sofia is the place to be at the end of September. The deadline for speaker applications is July 5th, 2014. Last year&#8217;s featured presenters included Matt Mullenweg, Joost de Valk, and Vitaly Friedman, along with many other internationally renowned speakers.

So, a couple of times each year, the team gets together to hang out and work on some fun projects. This past week, we all got together in Kansas City, Missouri (mainly for access to <a href=\"https://fiber.google.com/about/\">Google Fiber</a>!). We were pleasantly surprised by how much there was to do around the city and found its midwestern charm quite lovely. The area of town we stayed in, known as &#8216;The Crossroads&#8217;, was full of great food and interesting sights to take in.</p>
<p><img src=\"http://akismet.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/14214140438_3943c734ba_k1.jpg?w=300&h=199\" alt=\"Heavy Reading\" width=\"300\" height=\"199\" class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-1591\" />Once we were finished with our projects and made sure that the world was safe from spam, we went searching for fun. We discovered that Kansas City is home to the world&#8217;s only subterranean paintball course, where an old limestone mine was converted into a colorful battleground. It was a really unique and fantastic experience &#8211; minus the bruises! Highly recommended if you ever visit.</p>
<p>The most visible change around here as a result of the meetup is our <a href=\"http://akismet.com\">new and improved home page</a>. The old version had been around for quite some time, and our designer, Dan, had a really great vision for moving it forward. Super clean, a great flow, and with some awesome custom illustrations. There is even a little easter egg for you to discover (hint: contra)!</p>

<p>Embedded content with external requests can really slow a site down. This is especially true when the requests cannot be cached and the content would be impossible to host on your own domain, i.e. third party videos from Youtube and Vimeo. Calling external resources in these instances is unavoidable, but it doesn&#8217;t have to drag down your <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/?csw=1\" target=\"_blank\">PageSpeed</a> score.</p>
<p><a href=\"http://wordpress.org/plugins/lazy-load-for-videos/\" target=\"_blank\">Lazy Load for Videos</a> is a plugin created by WordPress developer <a href=\"http://kevinw.de/\" target=\"_blank\">Kevin Weber</a> to speed up sites that rely heavily on video content. You&#8217;ve probably already seen lazy loading for images, where you scroll down the page and the image appears as soon as it&#8217;s needed. Weber brings this concept to video loading.</p>
<p>Instead of loading up all the videos on your site, the plugin replaces Youtube and Vimeo embeds with a clickable preview image. Videos are only loaded when the visitor clicks on the image to play the video. The plugin uses jQuery to lazy load the videos, so no extra JavaScript is necessary. You can check out a <a href=\"http://kevinw.de/lazyloadvideos\" target=\"_blank\">live demo</a> on the plugin&#8217;s homepage.</p>
<p>Weber conducted a speed test using the <a href=\"https://developer.chrome.com/devtools/docs/network#network-panel-overview\" target=\"_blank\">Network Panel</a> in Chrome DevTools, which records the time of each requested resource. This image shows files that are loaded when the plugin is not in use and one Youtube video is embedded.</p>
<p><a href=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/before-lazy-load-videos.jpg\" rel=\"prettyphoto[25429]\"><img src=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/before-lazy-load-videos.jpg?resize=1000%2C371\" alt=\"before-lazy-load-videos\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-25431\" /></a></p>
<p>The image below shows files that are loaded when the plugin is in use and one Youtube video is embedded:</p>
<p><a href=\"http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/after-lazy-load-videos.jpg\" rel=\"prettyphoto[25429]\"><img src=\"http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/after-lazy-load-videos.jpg?resize=1000%2C371\" alt=\"after-lazy-load-videos\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-25432\" /></a></p>
<p>A quick comparison demonstrates a 50% reduction in the size of the requested resources and the latency, with nearly two seconds shaved off the load time. This represents the improvement for just one embedded video. You can imagine the savings on a video gallery where the site has to load YouTube&#8217;s scripts for each video on the page.</p>
<p>&#8220;I started to develop Lazy Load for Videos to improve page speed,&#8221; Weber told the Tavern. Over time, he began to add options for customizing the player styles. &#8220;Those new features were originated by the demands of the plugin&#8217;s users,&#8221; he said. They currently include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Display video titles on preview images</li>
<li>Add Custom CSS via plugin’s options panel</li>
<li>Hide controls from Youtube player</li>
<li>Support for videos in text widget (Youtube only)</li>
<li>Choose thumbnail size (standard or cover)</li>
<li>Choose between two colors for Youtube player (dark or light)</li>
<li>Choose between two colors for Youtube player’s video progress bar to highlight the amount of the video that the viewer has already seen (red or white)</li>
<li>Disable related videos at the end of videos</li>
</ul>
<p>In the future, Weber plans to include options to customize the Vimeo player styles. He will also be adding a CSS-only play button to further improve page speed in one of the next updates.

<p>The organizers of WordCamp Toronto 2014 are <a title=\"http://2014.toronto.wordcamp.org/2014/06/26/calling-all-speakers-for-wordcamp-toronto-2014/\" href=\"http://2014.toronto.wordcamp.org/2014/06/26/calling-all-speakers-for-wordcamp-toronto-2014/\">looking for speakers</a>. The event will take place on <strong>November 15-16th</strong> and will use the Twitter hashtag #WCTO. Although the event will feature the usual WordCamp sessions, there is a focus on accessibility (a11y) this year.</p>
<p>The organizing group wants to help raise awareness, compliance and the level of accessibility across all WordPress related projects.</p>
<blockquote><p>If you have expertise around web accessibility, <a title=\"http://www.aodacompliance.com/\" href=\"http://www.aodacompliance.com/\">AODA</a> and <a title=\"http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/wcag\" href=\"http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/wcag\">WCAG compliance</a>, assistive technologies or accessible WordPress projects, and are willing to share, we would definitely <a title=\"Speaker application form on Google Forms\" href=\"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/14lpuqKhBw0QJC2sf4oDKLGu81qOLnaiDgeqZExMokJs/viewform\">like to hear from you</a>!</p></blockquote>
<p>Considering the dismal state of affairs when it comes to <a title=\"http://wptavern.com/wordpress-themes-suck-at-accessibility-its-time-to-fix-it\" href=\"http://wptavern.com/wordpress-themes-suck-at-accessibility-its-time-to-fix-it\">accessibility in WordPress themes</a>, it&#8217;s nice to see WordCamp Toronto devote more attention to the subject. <a title=\"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/14lpuqKhBw0QJC2sf4oDKLGu81qOLnaiDgeqZExMokJs/viewform\" href=\"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/14lpuqKhBw0QJC2sf4oDKLGu81qOLnaiDgeqZExMokJs/viewform\">Speaker submissions</a> will be accepted until late August and will be reviewed on a first-in, first-out basis.</p>

Take WordPress for example. WordPress is a registered trademark overseen by the <a title=\"http://wordpressfoundation.org/trademark-policy/\" href=\"http://wordpressfoundation.org/trademark-policy/\">WordPress Foundation</a>. If someone wants to redistribute WordPress as is, they can under the terms of the GPLv2 license but would likely be stopped for trademark infringement as it would cause confusion with the official project.</p>

<p>According to <a title=\"http://www.uspto.gov/index.html\" href=\"http://www.uspto.gov/index.html\">USPTO.gov</a>, a <a title=\"http://www.uspto.gov/trademarks/basics/definitions.jsp\" href=\"http://www.uspto.gov/trademarks/basics/definitions.jsp\">trademark is defined as</a>:  a word, phrase, symbol, and/or design that identifies and distinguishes the source of the goods of one party from those of others. A <strong>service mark</strong> is a word, phrase, symbol, and/or design that identifies and distinguishes the source of a service rather than goods. The term “trademark” is often used to refer to both trademarks and service marks.</p>
<blockquote><p>The GPL is a license that defines the terms of use for the code. A license does not serve the same function as a copyright or trademark and the GPL itself is designed for software not for logos or names.</p></blockquote>
<p>Trademark registrants are obligated to enforce their trademark or risk losing it. Copyright and trademark laws are different and <a title=\"http://sarafhawkins.com/difference-copyright-vs-trademark-need-know/\" href=\"http://sarafhawkins.com/difference-copyright-vs-trademark-need-know/\">eloquently explained by Sara F. Hawkins</a>. She explains the similarities and differences along with the things you need to know about both. The <a title=\"http://www.law.washington.edu/lta/swp/law/trademark.html\" href=\"http://www.law.washington.edu/lta/swp/law/trademark.html\">Software Pluralism site</a> also has explanations with examples of how trademarks intersect with open source software.</p>
<p>Other WordPress companies that strictly enforce their trademarks are <a title=\"http://www.gravityforms.com/trademark/\" href=\"http://www.gravityforms.com/trademark/\">RocketGenius Inc. with GravityForms</a> and <a title=\"https://yoast.com/\" href=\"https://yoast.com/\">Joost De Valk</a> with the character mark of Yoast registered in both the US and the Netherlands. In a <a title=\"https://twitter.com/jeffr0/status/476923444299190273\" href=\"https://twitter.com/jeffr0/status/476923444299190273\">conversation on Twitter</a> with Carl Hancock and Joost De Valk, I discovered that enforcing trademarks is a full-time job for both.</p>
<h3>Trademarks Give Business Owners Leverage Where The GPL Does Not</h3>
<p>Of all the effort that was put into educating users and developers of the GPL in the past several years, what to do with trademarked material must have fallen through the cracks. It must be stressed that the GPL is a software license. Trademark and copyright laws are different and should be treated as such.</p>
<p>The responsibility is on the person forking and redistributing a plugin or theme to ensure no copyrights or trademarks are being infringed. Sean Lang learned this lesson the hard way when he tried to redistribute a version of WP Migrate DB Pro but <a title=\"http://wptavern.com/dmca-takedown-notice-issued-against-fork-of-wp-migrate-db-pro\" href=\"http://wptavern.com/dmca-takedown-notice-issued-against-fork-of-wp-migrate-db-pro\">mistakenly used copyrighted content</a> within the Readme.MD.</p>
<p>The following are general rules of thumb that should help avoid trouble when forking or redistributing a theme or plugin. These steps are especially important if you decide to fork and redistribute a commercial theme or plugin.</p>
<ul>
<li>Rename it. Keeping the same product name confuses users and possibly violates a trademark</li>
<li>Maintain the copyright of the original author</li>
<li>Do not use trademarked images, logos, etc.</li>
<li>Search for registered trademarks of the product and company name</li>
<li>Look for trademark information on the company&#8217;s website, usually found within the terms of service or in the footer.</li>
</ul>
<p>Registering a trademark for a WordPress product or company seems to be the way to go to ensure your brand and reputation is not being used maliciously or in a confusing manner. If WordPress companies had a secret weapon, it would be trademarks.</p>
<p>If you have registered a trademark for your WordPress product or company, please share your experience in the comments. Also feel free to share your process for dealing with infringements.</p>
<p>I am not a lawyer and this post should not be taken as legal advice. Please do your own research and contact the appropriate people to receive legal advice as copyright and trademark laws can be complex and hard to decipher.</p>

Version 2.4.3 and all <a title=\"http://wordpress.org/plugins/pods/developers/\" href=\"http://wordpress.org/plugins/pods/developers/\">previous versions</a> of the plugin have been patched in case you can&#8217;t upgrade to the latest version immediately.

<p>According to the announcement, those using the <strong>Extended Users Pod</strong> are especially at risk. The combination of a Pods AJAX-based form vulnerability combined with the Extended Users Pod could allow users to gain access as an administrator to a site.</p>
<blockquote><p>This vulnerability was due to an issue validating the “security key” (nonce) that is used to secure form submissions using Pods forms. Unfortunately, our form’s security validation was producing a false positive and did not validate it against the pod it was being checked against, and it did not throw any errors to alert us to the unintended consequences.</p>
<p>Our forms have been specifically designed to validate the user submitting them, the pod, the fields, and the item being created/modified. At first glance, the nonce would appear to work to anyone looking at the code, but close inspection found that there were two problems in how the security key was validated.</p></blockquote>
<p>For those curious, you can see what Scott Kingsley Clark did to fix the issue in <a href=\"https://github.com/pods-framework/pods/commit/01aa75c6af9001a126332d93344070488114d61b#diff-3674eeced1a3895af87f92459270f228R7757\" target=\"_blank\">this </a>and <a href=\"https://github.com/pods-framework/pods/commit/5db6f44f99ee482189aba29fd24fcfaab1ca8f25#diff-3674eeced1a3895af87f92459270f228R7762\" target=\"_blank\">another commit</a>.</p>

<p>Clark informed me this was his first time dealing with a situation like this. The first thing he did was hire Mark Jaquith through <a title=\"http://coveredwebservices.com/\" href=\"http://coveredwebservices.com/\">Covered Web Services</a> to perform a WordPress security audit to make sure the changes would fix the problem and not introduce new vulnerability&#8217;s.</p>

<p>When Lema published his thoughts on <a title=\"http://chrislema.com/pricing-wordpress-themes/\" href=\"http://chrislema.com/pricing-wordpress-themes/\">What Happens If WordPress Themes Get More Expensive?</a> and <a title=\"http://chrislema.com/wordpress-theme-cost/\" href=\"http://chrislema.com/wordpress-theme-cost/\">What Should A WordPress Theme Cost?</a> I thought he would answer a question I&#8217;ve been pondering for a while but it wasn&#8217;t even mentioned. Although he talks about various segments of the market, there is one segment that was not brought up. That is, the segment of taking advantage of the GPL to redistribute commercial products at a lower price.</p>
<h3>Will We See A Surge In The Not So Black Market?</h3>
<p>The more I read about the WordPress commercial theme space, the more I see the words <strong>raise prices</strong> and <strong>charge more</strong>. I understand the benefits to the business owner to charge higher prices as a means of becoming more sustainable. But, I don&#8217;t like paying higher prices for anything unless I determine it&#8217;s worth it.</p>
<div id=\"attachment_25380\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/CashRegisterFeaturedImage.png\" rel=\"prettyphoto[25349]\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-25380\" src=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/CashRegisterFeaturedImage.png?resize=637%2C200\" alt=\"Cash Register Featured Image\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">photo credit: <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/jalevega/8733967750/\">Historias Visuales</a> &#8211; <a href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/2.0/\">cc</a></p></div>
<p>So I wonder, if theme shops heed the advice of raising prices, how high will the price need to be before the freedoms of the GPL are used to create a surge of marketplaces or shops that become the <strong>not so black</strong> market? We&#8217;ve seen examples of this already through <a title=\"http://wpavengers.com/\" href=\"http://wpavengers.com/\">WP Avengers</a> which was started because of a <a title=\"http://wptavern.com/major-pricing-changes-at-woothemes\" href=\"http://wptavern.com/major-pricing-changes-at-woothemes\">major price increase and policy changes</a> at WooThemes surrounding WooCommerce. In a similar fashion, <a title=\"https://gplclub.org/\" href=\"https://gplclub.org/\">GPL Club</a> also redistributes WooCommerce extensions, themes, and plugins for a discounted subscription rate.</p>
<p>Whether it&#8217;s to make a quick buck or to get back at a company that raised prices, these renegade shops eat away at the lower end of the market. I&#8217;d like to see more theme and plugin shops provide an option to purchase updates but not support. Since customer support is usually cited as the most expensive part of running a business, why not offer a pricing tier to customers who don&#8217;t want or need it? At least this way a theme shop would be able to pass the savings to the customer with a lower price and provide more incentive for staying with the original vendor of a product.</p>
<h3>Higher Prices Seem Inevitable</h3>
<p>Although I haven&#8217;t gone theme shopping in a few years, my comfortable price point is between $50-$80. If a theme is a framework, I can see how $100 or more would be justified. In fact, the price hike of AESOP Story Engine from $40 to $120 is fine by me since it&#8217;s a unique product. What would shock me is to see $175-$300 single site support licensed themes become the new normal.</p>
<p>WooThemes was one of the first large WordPress product company&#8217;s to increase prices and drop their unlimited pricing tier. AESOP Story Engine has raised prices, and it&#8217;s only a matter of time before other commercial theme shops raise prices. I&#8217;m interested to see how many theme shops decide to sell individual themes for more than $100.</p>
<p>The sky isn&#8217;t going to fall because of rising prices but it will shake things up for consumers and business owners. It seems the days of $30-$70 themes appear to be over unless you stick with Themeforest. Ultimately, it&#8217;s up to the consumer to decide whether the price of a WordPress product is worth it.</p>
<p>Perhaps a rise in prices across the board is exactly what the doctor ordered. If price hikes result in better quality products, more innovation, and helps take WordPress to the next level, who wouldn&#8217;t get behind that?</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 26 Jun 2014 01:34:10 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Jeff Chandler\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:20;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"

<p>The groups component in BuddyPress allows members to create their own mini-social networks, each with its own homepage, activity stream, member directory and administrative panel. In networks where groups play a big part of the social activity, it becomes important to have a way to label or classify groups. When a group doesn&#8217;t have a full description, it&#8217;s not easy to differentiate it from the others or find similar groups.</p>
<p>BuddyPress core doesn&#8217;t yet have native support for group taxonomies, but the possibility is on the horizon with a <a href=\"https://buddypress.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/4017\" target=\"_blank\">ticket</a> open for discussion. In the meantime, Mathieu Viet has created a solution. Viet, better known as @imath, is a BuddyPress core developer and author of <a href=\"http://wptavern.com/experimental-buddypress-plugin-adds-finer-controls-for-public-groups\" target=\"_blank\">Alternative Public Group Control</a>, an experimental plugin that adds finer control for public groups.</p>
<p>As part of his professional life, @imath supports a social network that was in need of group taxonomies in order to help new members get connected to the right groups. He found that the existing <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/buddypress-group-tags/\" target=\"_blank\">BuddyPress Groups Tag</a> plugin didn&#8217;t work for him conceptually, because it relies on &#8220;groupmetas&#8221; to power the tagging features. @imath felt that groupmetas are better used to <em>describe</em> groups rather than to <em>classify</em> them.</p>
<h3>BP Groups Taxo Plugin Created to Add Tags to BuddyPress Groups</h3>
<p><a href=\"https://github.com/imath/bp-groups-taxo\" target=\"_blank\">BP Groups Taxo</a> is another experimental plugin that he created in order to provide a solution that would be maintainable over time. After researching, he found a way to register a custom taxonomy in order to provide tags for the groups component.</p>
<p>The plugin allows group administrators to select tags when creating a new group.</p>
<p><a href=\"http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/group-creation.jpg\" rel=\"prettyphoto[25323]\"><img src=\"http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/group-creation.jpg?resize=596%2C525\" alt=\"group-creation\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-25366\" /></a></p>
<p>With very little code, @imath was able to create an administration interface that allows admins/super admins to quickly add group tags. This screen is located under Groups >> Group Tags:</p>
<p><a href=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/group-tags-admin.jpg\" rel=\"prettyphoto[25323]\"><img src=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/group-tags-admin.jpg?resize=640%2C369\" alt=\"group-tags-admin\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-25370\" /></a></p>
<p>Groups will appear on the frontend in the directory with their corresponding tags:</p>
<p><a href=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/groups-directory.jpg\" rel=\"prettyphoto[25323]\"><img src=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/groups-directory.jpg?resize=640%2C554\" alt=\"groups-directory\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-25368\" /></a></p>
<p>Additionally, the plugin includes the ability to render the BuddyPress groups taxonomy within a tag cloud widget for displaying anywhere on the site.</p>
<p>@imath submitted a <a href=\"https://buddypress.trac.wordpress.org/timeline?from=2014-06-10T00%3A41%3A15Z&precision=second\" target=\"_blank\">patch</a> to BuddyPress core as a first pass at including group taxonomies, which would of course render his experimental plugin obsolete. The method essentially involves &#8220;<a href=\"https://buddypress.trac.wordpress.org/timeline?from=2014-06-04T20%3A48%3A26Z&precision=second\" target=\"_blank\">faking a post type</a>&#8221; in order to take advantage of the WordPress taxonomy API. There isn&#8217;t yet a clear path forward until WordPress resolves some <a href=\"http://make.wordpress.org/core/2013/07/28/potential-roadmap-for-taxonomy-meta-and-post-relationships/\" target=\"_blank\">long-term architecture challenges</a> surrounding taxonomy meta and post relationships.</p>
<p>If BuddyPress core contributors are to add support for group taxonomies, they will have to take the planned changes for WordPress into consideration. The discussion continues on this topic. For now, the <a href=\"https://github.com/imath/bp-groups-taxo\" target=\"_blank\">BP Groups Taxo</a> plugin is the best option for adding group tags to your BuddyPress site. Be advised that it&#8217;s still experimental and not yet ready for use in production. @imath welcomes your feedback and suggestions for the plugin on <a href=\"https://github.com/imath/bp-groups-taxo\" target=\"_blank\">GitHub</a>.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 26 Jun 2014 00:18:22 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:21;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"

<p>Security vulnerabilities have <a href=\"http://wptavern.com/timthumb-vulnerability-bites-another-victim\" target=\"_blank\">plagued</a> the <a href=\"https://timthumb.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/timthumb.php\" target=\"_blank\">TimThumb</a> script for years. It is most commonly used in cropping, zooming and resizing images in WordPress themes. After the <a href=\"http://blog.sucuri.net/2011/08/attacks-against-timthumb-php-in-the-wild-list-of-themes-and-plugins-being-scanned.html\" target=\"_blank\">large scale attacks</a> launched against the script a few years ago, one might think that theme and plugin developers would be less likely to continue building with it. However, this is not the case and many websites are again in danger, according to the exploit <a href=\"http://cxsecurity.com/issue/WLB-2014060134\" target=\"_blank\">disclosure</a> issued today.</p>
<p>TimThumb 2.8.13 has a vulnerability with its “Webshot” feature that, when enabled, allows attackers to execute commands on a remote website. At this time there is no patch. Security experts at Sucuri <a href=\"http://blog.sucuri.net/2014/06/timthumb-webshot-code-execution-exploit-0-day.html\" target=\"_blank\">break down the threat</a> as follows: <strong>&#8220;With a simple command, an attacker can create, remove and modify any files on your server.&#8221;</strong></p>
<p>Although the Webshot feature should be disabled by default, Sucuri recommends that you check your timthumb file to make sure it&#8217;s disabled. Search for “WEBSHOT_ENABLED” and verify that it&#8217;s set to &#8220;false,&#8221; as shown below:</p>
<pre class=\"brush: php; light: true; title: ; notranslate\">define (‘WEBSHOT_ENABLED’, false);</pre>
<p>This vulnerability affects many WordPress themes, plugins, and third party components. According to the disclosure, all themes from <a href=\"http://themify.me/\" target=\"_blank\">Themify</a> utilize this script, as well as several plugins, including <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-gallery-plugin/\" target=\"_blank\">WordPress Gallery Plugin</a> and the <a href=\"http://wordpress.org/plugins/igit-posts-slider-widget/\" target=\"_blank\">IGIT Posts Slider Widget</a>.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s important to recognize that your theme or plugin may also use this script, even if it&#8217;s not listed in the disclosure. If you&#8217;ve ever lost an entire weekend fixing client sites that fell victim to TimThumb exploits, then you know that disabling the WebShot option is probably a good idea. This is a simple thing that you can do now to prevent your sites from getting hacked.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 25 Jun 2014 18:48:35 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:24;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"

<p>WordPress 4.0 is on track to introduce several new oEmbed providers, according to the most recent <a href=\"http://make.wordpress.org/core/2014/06/19/last-week-in-wordpress-core-11/\" target=\"_blank\">core report</a> from Mike Schroder. The following sites and services have been added to the <a href=\"http://codex.wordpress.org/Embeds#oEmbed\" target=\"_blank\">whitelist of oEmbed providers</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>TED talks</li>
<li>Mixcloud</li>
<li>CollegeHumor.com</li>
<li>Issuu</li>
<li>Polldaddy’s short URL format</li>
<li>YouTube playlist URLs</li>
</ul>
<p>The <a href=\"http://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/design-decisions/#whitelisting-oembed-providers\" target=\"_blank\">process of getting added to the whitelist of providers</a> is not as easy as it seems. The design decision section of the WordPress core handbook states that the provider must be an established, popular, and trusted site. It must also properly and fully implement the <a href=\"http://oembed.com/\" target=\"_blank\">oEmbed specification</a>.</p>
<p>When determining how established and popular a service is, there are nine questions to consider, i.e. <em>&#8220;If similar services are already supported, how does this service compare in terms of size, features, and backing?&#8221;</em> and <em>&#8220;Does the service make an effort to build relationships with developers, such as through robust APIs?&#8221;</em> New oEmbed service providers that are proposed for inclusion in core will have to answer these considerations to ensure that it&#8217;s not a hasty, shortsighted addition.</p>
<p>However, if a site supports oEmbed, anyone can add the site and URL format to the internal whitelist by calling <a href=\"http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/wp_oembed_add_provider\" target=\"_blank\">wp_oembed_add_provider()</a>. Many plugins take this route when the provider hasn&#8217;t yet been added to core. For example, a trac <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/27658\" target=\"_blank\">ticket</a> was submitted for adding oembed support for CodePen. Since the site needs time to become established and popular, <a href=\"http://wptavern.com/new-plugin-adds-codepen-oembed-support-to-wordpress\" target=\"_blank\">a simple plugin</a> with one line of code uses the wp_oembed_add_provider() method to add support in the meantime. This helps to gauge the community&#8217;s interest before whitelisting the provider.</p>
<p>Of the six new providers listed above, the YouTube playlist URLs addition is likely to have the broadest appeal, given YouTube&#8217;s massive user base. You&#8217;ll be able to make use of the new oEmbed providers as soon as WordPress 4.0 ships. A beta is expected around the first week of July. The official release is targeted for the week of August 25.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 24 Jun 2014 23:18:49 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:27;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"

<p>This month we featured a project called <a href=\"http://wptavern.com/versionpress-hopes-to-bring-version-control-to-the-masses\" target=\"_blank\">VersionPress</a> that brings version control to WordPress, a concept that has many in the community excited. The VersionPress development team is seeking $30,000 in funding by the end of June in order to get it off the ground. However, they aren&#8217;t the only ones working on adding git-based version control to WordPress.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, developer Matt Shaw quietly released <a href=\"http://wordpress.org/plugins/revisr/\" target=\"_blank\">Revisr</a> on WordPress.org. Revisr is a plugin that allows developers to synchronize with any Git repository and easily commit, push, pull, and branch changes from within the WordPress admin. It&#8217;s different from VersionPress in that it&#8217;s designed to integrate with a remote repository, ie. one hosted on GitHub or Bitbucket. Unlike VersionPress, which hasn&#8217;t yet met its funding goals, <a href=\"http://wordpress.org/plugins/revisr/\" target=\"_blank\">Revisr</a> is free and available now.</p>
<p>The plugin  allows you to manage your WordPress website with a git repository and currently includes the following features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Track changes to the files and database of your WordPress installation</li>
<li>Optionally use different database versions for each branch</li>
<li>Commit and push changes to a remote repository (including Bitbucket and Github)</li>
<li>Pull changes down from a remote repository</li>
<li>Easily toggle between branches</li>
<li>Revert your website files and/or database to an earlier commit</li>
<li>Discard any unwanted changes</li>
<li>Manage .gitignore to prevent unwanted files/directories from being tracked</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>&#8220;I made Revisr to simplify the development process,&#8221;</strong> Shaw told the Tavern. &#8220;There are currently no plugins on WordPress.org that allow developers or site admins to use all of the main features of Git through the WordPress dashboard, and I made Revisr to do just that,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;At the same time, I wanted it to be simple enough so it could be used by people who aren&#8217;t necessarily interested in Git, but are interested in having backups and being able to quickly revert changes if needed.&#8221;</p>
<p>For the sake of user-friendliness, Revisr includes an interface in the admin for committing, reverting, pushing and pulling changes:</p>
<p><a href=\"http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/revisr-main-dashboard.png\" rel=\"prettyphoto[25260]\"><img src=\"http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/revisr-main-dashboard.png?resize=530%2C288\" alt=\"revisr-main-dashboard\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-25262\" /></a></p>
<p>Revisr makes it easy to view changes in files:</p>

<p>A commit history for the site is available in the WordPress admin:</p>
<p><a href=\"http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/revisr-commit-history.png\" rel=\"prettyphoto[25260]\"><img src=\"http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/revisr-commit-history.png?resize=530%2C309\" alt=\"revisr-commit-history\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-25264\" /></a></p>
<h3>How to Set Up Revisr</h3>
<p>The plugin has three requirements:</p>
<ul>
<li>A WordPress installation in the root folder of a Git repository</li>
<li>Git must be installed on the server (most updated versions of cPanel have it preinstalled)</li>
<li>PHP exec (safe mode off, can be configured in your php.ini)</li>
</ul>
<p>If you want to use Revisr with an existing site, you must ensure that the &#8220;.git&#8221; directory is in the root directory of the WordPress installation. The plugin will then attempt to use the settings stored in Git for pushing to/pulling from any remote repositories, which can be defined on the plugin settings page. Revisr supports git through SSH or HTTPS:</p>
<p><a href=\"http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/revisr-git-settings-options.png\" rel=\"prettyphoto[25260]\"><img src=\"http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/revisr-git-settings-options.png?resize=530%2C353\" alt=\"revisr-git-settings-options\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-25265\" /></a></p>
<p>If you&#8217;re using SSH for authentication, you will need to generate an SSH key and add it to Bitbucket/Github.</p>
<p>The process for setting up a new installation with Revisr is fairly easy:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create the repository on Bitbucket or Github</li>
<li>Clone the repository to your computer, add WordPress, and push it to the repository.</li>
<li>Upload the entire repository to the server, install WordPress, and add Revisr</li>
</ul>
<h3>Benefits of Using Revisr: Revision Tracking, Branching, and Backups</h3>
<p>Matt Shaw believes that Revisr can benefit WordPerss admins in several ways in addition to revision tracking. &#8220;Revisr helps the admins see all files that have been changed and the specific changes within those,&#8221; he said. &#8220;This is an advantage if many files need to be modified and helps to keep issues at a minimum. An added benefit is having backups and being able to quickly spot and revert some website hacks if they occur.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Branching also enables site admins to easily test theme changes or new functionality and quickly toggle back and forth between different versions of the site,&#8221; Shaw noted. &#8220;For example, a site admin could create a new branch to preview layout changes, and switch back to the original branch and old layout if needed.&#8221;</p>
<p>Recent updates to the plugin include the option to keep the database separate between branches. This allows users to go back and restore the database from any commit in which the database was also backed up.</p>
<p>Since Revisr tracks both database and file changes, it is suitable for keeping a complete backup of the site. Site admins can easily make full restore points before major changes such as a WordPress core or plugin upgrade.</p>
<p>In the next major update, Shaw plans to give admins more control on what gets committed and reverted, allowing specific files to be reverted without affecting the overall project. He also plans on adding the ability to tag commits with a version number and the ability to view/merge changes between branches. Future versions of the plugin will include the ability to merge changes between branches and the ability to schedule backups of both the website files and database.</p>
<h3>The Future of the Revisr Plugin</h3>
<p>I asked Shaw about the future of the plugin and if he plans on monetizing it. &#8220;The plugin will always be completely free and open source,&#8221; he replied. &#8220;We are also working on a paid standalone application that can interface with Revisr that will allow teams and web firms to manage multiple websites using Git. However, the full functionality of the plugin will always be free.&#8221;</p>
<p>Shaw is working with a team that aims to launch Revisr Pro, a paid application, later this year. Revisr Pro will work with any type of project, but it will also be able to interface with the Revisr plugin via an API to add more features to both the plugin and the standalone application. &#8220;It&#8217;s designed to simplify managing large amounts of websites (20+) with multiple environments, with file and database tracking with Git, project-level tasks, and team support,&#8221; Shaw said. &#8220;Revisr Pro is also able to deploy and configure new projects, simplifying the workflow for teams using Git, and allowing more time to be spent focused on the project itself.&#8221; They plan to feature straightforward pricing, and won&#8217;t charge for additional users or projects.</p>
<p>Shaw is currently the sole developer on the Revisr WordPress plugin project, although he has friends who are helping out with testing and design. His plugin is different from <a href=\"http://versionpress.net/\" target=\"_blank\">VersionPress</a> in that it isn&#8217;t targeted toward bringing version control to the masses. Revisr is geared more toward developers and isn&#8217;t supported by a crowd-funding campaign. Shaw is just one man working to create a plugin that helps improve his own workflow. You can download <a href=\"http://wordpress.org/plugins/revisr/screenshots/\" target=\"_blank\">Revisr on WordPress.org</a> and watch for updates as the plugin continues to develop.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 24 Jun 2014 19:53:54 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:28;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"

With a little bit of pricing strategy, these comparison tables can be an effective way of positioning your packages for better sales.</p>
<p>Creating and styling pricing tables can be a challenge if you&#8217;re not very handy with HTML and CSS. <a href=\"http://wordpress.org/plugins/easy-pricing-table-manager/\" target=\"_blank\">Easy Pricing Table</a> is a new free plugin that aims to make it simple for anyone to set up a visually compelling pricing table. The default design is a flat style with colors that can be set via a user-friendly colorpicker in the admin.</p>
<p><a href=\"http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/pricing-tables.png\" rel=\"prettyphoto[25218]\"><img src=\"http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/pricing-tables.png?resize=1025%2C639\" alt=\"pricing-tables\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-25221\" /></a></p>
<p>The pricing table is responsive and includes smooth hover effects when mousing over the columns. A live demo is available at <a href=\"http://jwthemes.com/easy-pricing-table/\" target=\"_blank\">JW Themes and Plugins</a>.</p>
<p>Easing Pricing Table has a settings panel where you can easily customize the appearance of the table as well as each individual column. You&#8217;ll have the option to set the title, price, features, duration, button text, URL, column color and order.</p>
<p><a href=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/pricing-details.png\" rel=\"prettyphoto[25218]\"><img src=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/pricing-details.png?resize=889%2C1134\" alt=\"pricing-details\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-25235\" /></a></p>
<p>Tables can be displayed using the auto-generated shortcode or via a widget. The plugin allows you to create multiple pricing tables and maintain separate customization settings for each. Be advised that if the pricing tables don&#8217;t match the demo exactly, it&#8217;s likely because they are designed to take on some of the characteristics of your theme, ie. typography, headline styles, etc. You can further customize this via CSS if necessary.</p>
<p>I was impressed by how easy this plugin is to use. Many other pricing table plugins also use shortcodes, but they often require you to manually input all the information as attributes. This becomes messy and difficult to visualize. However, this plugin does an excellent job of providing an interface that allows you to quickly create, customize, and visualize the columns of your pricing table.</p>
<p><a href=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/columns.png\" rel=\"prettyphoto[25218]\"><img src=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/columns.png?resize=1025%2C490\" alt=\"columns\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-25253\" /></a></p>
<p><a href=\"http://wordpress.org/plugins/easy-pricing-table-manager/\" target=\"_blank\">Easy Pricing Table</a> is one of the fastest ways to create a beautiful pricing table without having to touch any code. If you&#8217;re using a theme with a flat style design, then this plugin should drop in nicely. Download it for free from WordPress.org.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 24 Jun 2014 01:48:46 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:32;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"

The WP API team is aiming to have it <a href=\"http://wptavern.com/json-rest-api-slated-for-wordpress-4-1-release\" target=\"_blank\">ready for inclusion in WordPress 4.1</a>, which will drop later this year.</p>
<p>This release focused heavily on testing, fixing bugs discovered through tests, and improving the API documentation. New routes have been added for taxonomies and terms. Excerpts and password-protected post handling have also been improved. Revision endpoint tests are new in 1.1. Coverage for post endpoint testing is now at more than 54% for the whole class and more than 80% for the main methods. McCue says this figure will continue to rise over the next few releases. You can <a href=\"https://github.com/WP-API/WP-API/compare/1.0...1.1\" target=\"_blank\">view all the changes and bug fixes</a> for this release on GitHub.</p>
<p>The WP API team often receives questions regarding how to handle authentication. Version 1.1 includes full <a href=\"https://github.com/WP-API/WP-API/blob/master/docs/authentication.md\" target=\"_blank\">documentation on authentication methods</a>, including cookie authentication (for plugins/themes running on a site) and OAuth (for desktop/web/mobile clients accessing a site externally). A basic authentication method is also included in the docs and is useful for development purposes only.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been working with the WP API team to help get documentation organized and presented in a way that&#8217;s easy to read and navigate. We&#8217;re in the process of merging all the docs into one centralized hub at <a href=\"http://wp-api.org/\" target=\"_blank\">wp-api.org</a>, which pulls from the various docs in the <a href=\"https://github.com/WP-API\" target=\"_blank\">WP API</a> GitHub repos. We&#8217;re working to make this a top-notch resource for any developer who wants to build with the new API.</p>

<p>Work for <a href=\"https://github.com/WP-API/WP-API/issues?milestone=7&state=open\" target=\"_blank\">version 1.2</a> is already underway. &#8220;With version 1.2 and onwards, we’ll be tackling a bunch of <a href=\"https://github.com/WP-API/WP-API/issues?labels=Testing\" target=\"_blank\">extra testing for our endpoints</a>, with the aim of eventually reaching >90% coverage,&#8221; McCue noted in the <a href=\"http://make.wordpress.org/core/2014/06/23/json-rest-api-version-1-1/\" target=\"_blank\">release announcement</a>.

<p>PressNomics is a three-day event to relax, collaborate, and discuss the economics surrounding WordPress.  Notable speakers in the past include Mark Jaquith, Cory Miller, and Mikkel Svane. <a title=\"http://chrislema.com/pressnomics-good-bad-awesome/\" href=\"http://chrislema.com/pressnomics-good-bad-awesome/\">Chris Lema</a> and <a title=\"http://mattreport.com/pressnomics-review/\" href=\"http://mattreport.com/pressnomics-review/\">Matt Mederios</a> both have great reviews of the event when they attended in 2013. It&#8217;s quickly become one of the premiere events outside of WordCamps.</p>
<p>PressNomics is something I&#8217;ve been wanting to attend since its creation. I was never able to attend due to finances and timing. However, I&#8217;m happy to say that I&#8217;ll be in attendance for version 3 of the event and will be covering it for the Tavern.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m really looking forward to surrounding myself with the movers and shakers of the WordPress business world. I want to know what everyone is thinking and get a feel for what direction WordPress is heading. Let me know in the comments if you plan on going to PressNomics 3.

Over the years, the meta information I give images has changed from very little to as descriptive as possible. For example, we use a theme that utilizes featured images. When I upload a featured image, I&#8217;ll give it a title that&#8217;s descriptive to the post it will be attached to.</p>
<p>In this example, the title of the image is <em>Market Share Pie Featured Image</em> since the post it would be attached to talks about the market share of GravityForms and would be the featured image for the post. For the Alt Text, I described the image as,<em> GravityForms Market Share Pie Featured Image</em>. The ALT text is usually just the image title with spaces in between.</p>
<p><a href=\"http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/HowILabelFeaturedImages.png\" rel=\"prettyphoto[25166]\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-25167\" src=\"http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/HowILabelFeaturedImages.png?resize=553%2C620\" alt=\"HowILabelFeaturedImages\" /></a></p>
<p>When I need to reuse a featured image, all I have to do is search for <strong>Featured Image</strong> in the media library. The search results are made up of all of the previous featured images I&#8217;ve uploaded. Since we don&#8217;t have too many to wade through, finding the one I want doesn&#8217;t take long.</p>
<h3>Empowered To Improve Media Library Search Results</h3>
<p>The WordPress media library is an archive of content. The larger it gets, the more difficult it can be to find things. Personally, I think being as descriptive as possible with each field with the exception of the caption is the easiest way to improve the media library search engine results. If I fail to be descriptive with images and provide ample meta information, then whose fault is it when the media library can&#8217;t find what I&#8217;m looking for?</p>
<p>This is one of those areas of WordPress where I believe users are empowered. They have the choice of either providing as much or as little information as possible. I think the less information provided over time could prove to be detrimental to the media library search functionality. I&#8217;d love to hear from those with experience in this area, especially from site owners who have thousands of items within their media library.</p>
<p><strong>What naming convention you use to manage your WordPress media library?</strong> Do you use any plugins to aid in media management? I don&#8217;t think my convention is the best, but it works for me.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 23 Jun 2014 03:46:14 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Jeff Chandler\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:39;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"

Manually adding users with avatars, activity updates, messages, etc,  can be a tedious process. Fortunately, there&#8217;s a way to automate the creation of demo data.</p>
<p>The <a href=\"http://wordpress.org/plugins/bp-default-data/\" target=\"_blank\">BuddyPress Default Data</a> plugin instantly creates a bunch of users, messages, friend connections, groups, topics, and activity items for testing purposes. Users are created with avatars generated by <a href=\"http://8biticon.com/\" target=\"_blank\">8biticon.com</a>. After installing the plugin, you&#8217;ll have the option to select what kind of demo data you want to create:</p>
<p><a href=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/buddypress-default-data.png\" rel=\"prettyphoto[25131]\"><img src=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/buddypress-default-data.png?resize=1025%2C565\" alt=\"buddypress-default-data\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-25139\" /></a></p>
<p>After you make your selections and import the data, you&#8217;ll see a success message detailing all the new data created:</p>
<p><a href=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/success.png\" rel=\"prettyphoto[25131]\"><img src=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/success.png?resize=690%2C364\" alt=\"success\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-25141\" /></a></p>
<p>Check your site and you&#8217;ll find all the new members, activity, groups, etc. Activity items will all have the same timestamp, as they were created at the same time.</p>
<p><a href=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/activity.png\" rel=\"prettyphoto[25131]\"><img src=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/activity.png?resize=800%2C387\" alt=\"activity\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-25147\" /></a></p>
<p>Before using the plugin, you&#8217;ll want to make sure to turn off email notifications for the admin user or else you&#8217;ll blow up your inbox with a ton of emails generated by the data as it&#8217;s created.</p>
<p>The plugin also has the ability to automatically clean out all the test data when you&#8217;re finished. Using the &#8220;Clear BuddyPress Data&#8221; button will truncate the tables for messages, groups, notifications, friends and forum posts. Be advised that it will delete all users except for the one with ID=1 and all the corresponding data, i.e. usermeta, activity, etc. This plugin should be used with caution and only on a test site.</p>
<p>Hopefully the <a href=\"http://wordpress.org/plugins/bp-default-data/\" target=\"_blank\">BuddyPress Default Data</a> plugin will save you a little time when testing BuddyPress and its extensions. You can download it from WordPress.org. If WP-CLI is part of your workflow, then you might opt for using Boone Gorges&#8217; <a href=\"http://wptavern.com/a-library-of-wp-cli-commands-for-buddypress\" target=\"_blank\">WP-CLI community package of BuddyPress commands</a>. It allows you to quickly create demo data using the command line.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Sun, 22 Jun 2014 02:15:26 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:44;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"

The rare opportunity to build or renovate a kitchen is a chance to make a smart investment. Do it right, and your new kitchen can dramatically increase the value of your home (to the extent that the kitchen well-and-truly pays for itself, when it comes time to sell).
That’s why we specialise in kitchens and cabinets, done right. You won’t find any mass-produced doors or finicky, poor-fitting flat-packs here.

The rare opportunity to build or renovate a kitchen is a chance to make a smart investment. Do it right, and your new kitchen can dramatically increase the value of your home (to the extent that the kitchen well-and-truly pays for itself, when it comes time to sell).
That’s why we specialise in kitchens and cabinets, done right. You won’t find any mass-produced doors or finicky, poor-fitting flat-packs here.
Instead, we craft custom designed, made-to-measure fittings, often using the finest Jarrah timber (our specialty).

The rare opportunity to build or renovate a kitchen is a chance to make a smart investment. Do it right, and your new kitchen can dramatically increase the value of your home (to the extent that the kitchen well-and-truly pays for itself, when it comes time to sell).
That’s why we specialise in kitchens and cabinets, done right. You won’t find any mass-produced doors or finicky, poor-fitting flat-packs here.
Instead, we craft custom designed, made-to-measure fittings, often using the finest Jarrah timber (our specialty).
Artra custom kitchens and cabinets strike the perfect balance between visual appeal and practicality (the keys to creating a ‘wow factor’ home or premises). Our craftsmanship is sure to breathe life into your renovated area and be a talking point for years to come.
